 --> Version history:
 --------------------
 -> version 1.24: 30.01.2012
    - '-clust' for PDBs: hierarchical complete linkage clustering
       with respect to backbone shape similarity
    - fixed a minor bug in aromaticity detection

 -> version 1.23: 22.10.2011
    - speedup in shape-based protein alignment (-oa2)
    - tolerance for deviations in shape-based
       alignment can now be changed by the user

 -> version 1.22: 08.10.2011
    - cleaned up some parts of the source code

 -> version 1.21: 27.09.2011
    - deleted the old Changelog
    - started to clear out some parts of the code (still a lot to do)
        => some significant changes in the routines for atom type
           perception => Please watch the results carefully, as some
           newly introduced BUGs are possible! However, the overall
           performance should have been improved.
    - 2 new atom types
    - 2 new options:
        -> '-NCA': This flag disables the possibility of charged aromatics
        -> '-KA': This flag set alternating double bonds instead of
                  aromatic bond type
    - slightly speedup in RMSD calculation
